  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    The need to use existing components across multiple products required significant customization, which made the components increasingly complex and difficult to maintain. To solve this, we developed our own components, inspired by Radix UIâ€™s design approach.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    The implementation of the components is based on the principles of
    modularity and reusability. The components are designed to be as flexible as
    possible, allowing for a high degree of customization.
