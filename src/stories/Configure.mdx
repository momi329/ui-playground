<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div className="content">
  The need to use existing components across multiple products required
  significant customization, which made the components increasingly complex and
  difficult to maintain. To solve this, we developed our own components,
  inspired by Radix UIâ€™s design approach.
</div>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<div className="content">
  The implementation of the components is based on the principles of
  modularity and reusability. The components are designed to be as flexible as
  possible, allowing for a high degree of customization.
